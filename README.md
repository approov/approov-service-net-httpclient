# Approov SDK bindings for .NET HttpClient


A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://approov.io) to enable easy integration when using [`MAUI`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) applications for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov using [`HttpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient). In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

Please see [MAUI](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-maui-httpclient) quickstart for usage information.
